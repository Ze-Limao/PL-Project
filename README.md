# PL-Project

This project is a compiler that translates Forth code into pseudo machine code.  
The implementation is based on **Context-Free Grammar** and utilizes [**PLY**](https://ply.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (Python Lex-Yacc) for lexical and syntactic analysis.  

## Features
- Compiles Forth code into pseudo machine code
- Uses **PLY** for lexing and parsing
- Based on **Context-Free Grammar (CFG/GIC)**

## Dependencies
- Python
- PLY (Python Lex-Yacc)

## Usage
To run the compiler, execute:  
```bash
python main.py input.txt
```
